# AI for TSP Competition

## Goal

In the AI for TSP competition we try to solve optimization problems using machine learning. The competition will be hosted at the [Data Science meets Optimization workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/ijcai2021dso) at IJCAI21 and consists of two tracks:

* Online supervised learning using surrogate models
* Reinforcement learning

The goal of this competition is to strengthen the relation between the machine learning field and the optimization field. You can learn more about the competition [here](https://tspcompetition.com/competition).
